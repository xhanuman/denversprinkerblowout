                        Is your Denver water bill higher than normal?; If you have pipes leaking underground, we’ll take care of this problem using the best materials and methods. Often, a failing diaphragm is the culprit allowing water to continuously leak out of the system – this may be the case if your water bill is higher than average for any given month.

                        Another sprinkler repair involves the overgrown grass and soil buildup which slowly buries the sprinkler heads. This clearly reduces their functionality and effectiveness. Generally, the head needs to be excavated and if it isn’t clogged with sediment, it can be elevated. It’s best to go ahead and replace the sprinkler head with a new unit in order to ensure trouble-free operation for the next few years.
