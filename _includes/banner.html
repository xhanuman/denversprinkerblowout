                   In general it is safest to have your sprinkler startup in Denver scheduled anytime after April 16th. However, thereâ€™s always around a 25% chance of a mild freeze until approx. May 19th (however, this would normally only affect young plants and not your pipes).

## Introduction

A well-maintained sprinkler system is essential for a healthy lawn. As the seasons change, it's crucial to properly start up your sprinkler system to ensure optimal performance and prevent damage.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Sprinkler Start-Up

Follow these steps to start up your sprinkler system effectively:

### 1. Inspect Your Sprinkler Components

Before turning on the water, visually inspect all sprinkler heads, valves, and pipes for any signs of damage or wear. Replace any broken components and clear debris from around the sprinkler heads.

### 2. Gradually Open the Main Water Valve

Slowly opening the main water valve prevents a sudden surge of water pressure that could damage your sprinkler system. Turn the valve counterclockwise until it's fully open, allowing water to fill the pipes gradually.

### 3. Check for Leaks

As water fills the pipes, carefully inspect your sprinkler system for any leaks. If you notice water pooling around sprinkler heads or valves, you may need to replace or tighten the affected components.

### 4. Test Each Sprinkler Zone

Activate each sprinkler zone individually using your controller. Observe the water pressure and coverage, making adjustments to sprinkler heads as needed to ensure even distribution.

### 5. Set Your Sprinkler Schedule

Program your controller with the appropriate watering schedule for your lawn's needs. Consider factors such as soil type, plant species, and local weather conditions when setting your watering frequency and duration.

## Common Sprinkler System Issues and Solutions

Here are some common sprinkler system issues and their solutions:

- **Low Water Pressure**: Check for leaks or obstructions in the pipes, and ensure the main water valve is fully open.
- **Uneven Water Distribution**: Adjust the angle and direction of sprinkler heads, and consider adding more heads if necessary.
